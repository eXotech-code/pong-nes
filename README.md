# PONG clone for NES (WIP)

This is a simple ATARI PONG clone written for the NES in 6502 Assembly.
I am mostly working off of the [Nerdy Nights](https://nerdy-nights.nes.science) guide which i highly recommend.

## What's working and what's planned:
- [x] Wall collision
- [x] Controlling paddles
- [ ] Paddle collision
- [ ] Remove left and right wall collision
- [ ] Better sprites for paddles and ball
- [ ] Reset ball placement when off screen
- [ ] Point counter
- [ ] Multi user support
